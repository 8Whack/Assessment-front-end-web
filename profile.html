    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>As you might be able to tell from my list of hobbies, I've picked up more than a few random skills over the years. I'm most proud of my circus skills and my creative outlets (Blacksmithing, Woodworking, Leatherworking), since those have led me to some really interesting careers. </p>
    <p>When I was in my late teens/early twenties, I joined the circus for a few years as a juggler and aerial perfomer. I've also worked as a carpenter and blacksmith, and one of my all-time favorite projects to work on a replica of Aragon's sword from Lord of the Rings.</p>
    <p>Last but certainly not least, I'm very proud of my interpersonal skills. As you might guess, I've met all sorts of interesting people, and learning to interact in a positive manner with all sorts of people has led to me being very experienced and confident around everyone that I meet.</p>
    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>My end goal for a career, is one where I can travel. I've spent a lot of time exploring the USA, but now I want to expand my list of countries I've been to. I'm looking for a job that lets me work remote, so I can work anywhere in the world so long as I have an internet connection. That's why I learned to code- as long as I have a laptop and a stable internet connection, it won't matter where I am. I could be relaxing in my home, in a mountain resort in the Alps, or on the beach in Bali, and I'd still be able to work and finance all my trips. That's amazing!</p>
